Assignment Prompt:  
Create a counter.  
The default constructor should set the count to zero.  
The overloaded constructor should initialize to any integer.  
Provide a display(), inc() and dec() method.  
Inc does ++ dec does – –  on the private count variable.  
Use private: and public: where they should be used.  
  
Write a demo program that initializes one counter to 0 and the other to 200.   
Increment the first counter by 85 and decrement the second counter by 242.  
Use a for loop to increment and decrement.  
  
Use a static variable to keep track of the total number of incs and decs.  
Keep in mind that after you declare a static variable in a class, you must declare  
it outside the class and use the scope resolution operator.
