Assignments from CIT245 - Data Structures and Programming C++  
  
Assignment Prompt:  
Write a program that computes buoyant force given the radius and weight of a sphere.  
Buoyant Force = Volume x Water Weight (62.4 lbs/cubic foot).  
Your program should decide whether a sphere sinks or floats in water.  
The user inputs the radius of the sphere and the weight. Volume = 4/3 pi r^3. 
Use const double PI = 3.141592; for PI.

Your program must prompt for multiple calculations.  

Example Output:  

This program computes Buoyant Force in water given sphere radius.  
Based on the weight of the sphere, it determines whether the sphere floats or sinks.  
  
  
Enter the radius of the sphere.
