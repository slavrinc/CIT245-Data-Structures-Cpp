Assignments from CIT245 - Data Structures and Programming C++

Assignment Prompt:
Write a program that applies the Babylonian square root algorithm.  

The algorithm is: 

1)	guess = input/2
2)	r = input/guess
3)	guess = (guess+r)/2
4)	go to 2 until done

Example output:

Enter a number and I will apply the Babylonian square root algorithm
until I am withing .001 of the correct answer.
151
You entered 151
guessing 38.75
guessing 21.3234
guessing 14.2024
guessing 12.4172
guessing 12.2889
The Babylons algorithm gives 12.2889
Checking: 12.2889 * 12.2889 = 151.016
